## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust and interpretable fraud detection system. The pipeline covers:

- 🔗 **Data loading** from a provided external source (`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection`)
- ✅ **Data validation & cleaning**
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using static and interactive visualizations
- 🛠️ **Feature engineering** and transformation
- 🧠 **Feature selection** using recursive methods
- ⚖️ **Handling imbalanced data**
- 🤖 **Model training** with:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
## 🧠 Author Notes

This notebook demonstrates a practical end-to-end ML workflow for structured/tabular data, with a strong emphasis on best practices like modular preprocessing and handling real-world challenges like class imbalance.
